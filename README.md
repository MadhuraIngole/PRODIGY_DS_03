# DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER
This project involves building a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The classifier will analyze various features and make predictions based on patterns identified in the data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
  
- Libraries:
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib

## Dataset
Ensure your dataset is in a CSV format and contains relevant demographic and behavioral features. The dataset should have columns representing these features along with a target column indicating purchase status.

## Usage
- Prepare your data:
   - Ensure your data is clean and properly formatted.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Run the classifier
- Visualize the Decision Tree

## Evaluation
The performance of the decision tree classifier can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics can be obtained using the classification_report from scikit-learn.

## Conclusion
This decision tree classifier provides a simple yet powerful way to predict customer purchase behavior based on demographic and behavioral data. By analyzing patterns in the data, businesses can make informed decisions and tailor their marketing strategies accordingly.
